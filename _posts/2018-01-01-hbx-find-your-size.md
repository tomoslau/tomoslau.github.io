We kickstarted tackling product returns by analyzing data to validate the top reason for returns: due to wrong size. Through user interviews and testing, we found that this was due to brands using different sizing and the difficulty of using traditional sizing charts. Most shoppers didnâ€™t know their detailed body measurements like chest circumference and shoulder width, but knew their height and weight off the top of their head.

**How might we help and encourage shoppers to find a more accurate size?**

To simplify the process, we mapped the body measurements to the height and weight and tested with our coworkers in the office to refine the accuracy. We found that people who had a flat/round belly or broad/slim shoulders produced a wider range of results, so we added those options to the flow and encouraged them to input their body measurements for a more reliable size recommendation.

We AB tested the call-to-cation on the product page to determine the most effective design.

Outcome: three months after we launched the size recommendation, returns due to improper sizing dropped by 86%.
