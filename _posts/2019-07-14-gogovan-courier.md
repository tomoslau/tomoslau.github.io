Nine months into launching GOGO Delivery, the demand grew to a point where the supply couldn't keep up. To increase completion rate, our theme pivoted our objective to improve courier activation.

## My role

I led the design for courier experience and worked closely with the operations team to understand courier behavior.

## Research

Through user interviews and focus groups, we found that couriers had difficulty in finding relevant orders. A few months ago, when there was less demand, there were only around twenty pending orders that couriers can pick at a given time. Now, there's over a hundred.

We learned that couriers select orders based on distance from pick up location, drop off location and earnings. To empathize with our couriers, our team went out and delivered packages. This enabled further learnings such as order bundling planning and package size, weight considerations.

## Design sprint

I led a design sprint with cross-functional teams to identify the key problems to tackle for courier activation and decide which ideas to test.

We expolored the most popular idea: a visual map to show couriers available orders based on their location and suggesting bundling to increase efficiency and income.

We also explored using filters and sorting to help couriers find relevant orders. We tested the prototype with couriers and made several iterations to suit their needs and technical constraints.
