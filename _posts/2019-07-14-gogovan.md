GOGOVAN launched a new crowd-sourced same-day delivery service in 2018 summer. The service targets small-medium businesses with ad-hoc urgent delivery needs in Hong Kong.

## Reducing oversize and overweight orders

During the first week of launch, we noticed a high cancellation rate, where 80% of cancellations were due to shippers placing orders with **oversized, overweight or multiple packages**. 

### Process & experience

To understand the problem, I asked the experts from our operations, customer service, engineering and data teams. 

“Shippers assume our couriers deliver packages using **vans**,” Jackie, head of customer service, said, “but in reality, our couriers are **walkers** (couriers who travel on foot and public transport).” This led to oversized, overweight or multiple packages that were physically impossible for a courier to carry.

My PM Waikit and I made some quick sketches and voted to explore and decide which ideas to test in our prototype.

<figure class="ratio-4x3"><img class="lazy" data-src="/assets/ggv-oversize-screens.png" alt="1. Added package type options to show what kind of packages are acceptable for couriers to deliver. 2. Helper text with a link to direct oversized delivery needs to our van service. 3. An option for oversized packages that direct to our van service."></figure>

1. Redesigned service icon and label to clarify our couriers’ **mode of transport**
2. Added package type options to show **what kind of packages are acceptable for couriers to deliver**
3. Helper text with a link to direct oversized delivery needs to our van service
4. An option for oversized packages that direct to our van service

We tested the prototype with five shippers unfamiliar with our new service:

- On the new order screen, all testers understood that courier deliveries are carried out by a walker or biker.
- When tasked to place an order that exceeds the size or weight limit, all testers successfully switched to van service.

### The outcome

Due to scope vs outcome, we decided to implement the new service icon, helper text, oversize/overweight options and not add package type options to the order form. 

One month after the release, cancellations due to oversized items by new shippers reduced by 37%. Overall cancellation rate dropped 17%.

### Lessons learned

1. The problem of shippers not understanding our service wasn’t identified during the closed beta period prior to launch because our sales team onboarded each user so they had a good understanding of the service. When new customers started using the service, the problems started to show up. **Test product onboarding with completely new users.**
2. Talking to our operations and customer service team gave us valuable insight into the problems we were tackling because they communicated with the shippers frequently. **Talk to people who listen to  our users' problems regularly.**
3. Asking for feedback on the product copy made me realize that simple words can be improved to convey more meaning. For example, I learned that there are different words in Chinese for “package” and one of them implies a small package. **Always ask for advice.**
