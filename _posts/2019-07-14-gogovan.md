GOGOVAN launched a new crowd-sourced same-day delivery service in 2018 summer. The service targets small-medium businesses with ad-hoc urgent delivery needs in Hong Kong.

## Reducing oversize and overweight orders

During the first week of launch, we noticed a high cancellation rate, where 80% of cancellations were due to shippers placing orders with **oversized, overweight or multiple packages**. 

### Process & experience

To understand the problem, I asked the experts from our operations, customer service, engineering and data teams. 

“Shippers assume our couriers deliver packages using **vans**,” Jackie, head of customer service, said, “but in reality, our couriers are **walkers** (couriers who travel on foot and public transport).” This led to oversized, overweight or multiple packages that were physically impossible for a courier to carry.

My PM Waikit and I wrote out some How Might We's, made some quick sketches and voted to decide which ideas to test in our prototype. We tested the prototype with five shippers unfamiliar with our service, and all testers understood that courier deliveries are carried out by a walker or biker. They also successfully switched to the van service when tasked to deliver a larger or heavier item.

### The outcome

Due to scope vs outcome, we decided to implement the new service icon, helper text, oversize/overweight options and not add package type options to the order form. 

One month after the release, cancellations due to oversized items by new shippers reduced by 37%. Overall cancellation rate dropped 17%.

## Scheduled delivery

Through interviews with e-commerce shippers and local boutique store visits, we learned that shippers wanted to be able to schedule deliveries for the next day so they can **place multiple orders at the same time without worrying about it the next morning**. Our customer service team also informed us that many clients found it **difficult to understand the cut-off time for each drop-off option**.

### Process & experience

To improve the clarity of drop-off times, we worked with the operations and marketing team to make the times more memorable by rounding the times to the closest hour and displaying all drop-off options even when they're not available. We also added helper text to make the cut-off time more transparent.

		</video>
	</div>

We tested the prototype with users and they found the helper text most useful in understanding the options. However, some users found the "available if…" helper text on available options confusing, so we decided to only show it when the option is disabled.

### The outcome
After shipping the scheduling feature, the percentage of scheduled orders increased by 270%. Scheduled orders make 20–30% of our daily orders.

## Lessons learned

1. The problem of shippers not understanding our service wasn’t identified during the closed beta period prior to launch because our sales team onboarded each user so they had a good understanding of the service. When new customers started using the service, the problems started to show up. **Test product onboarding with completely new users.**
2. Talking to our operations and customer service team gave us valuable insight into the problems we were tackling because they communicated with the shippers frequently. **Talk to people who listen to  our users' problems regularly.**
3. Asking for feedback on the product copy made me realize that simple words can be improved to convey more meaning. For example, I learned that there are different words in Chinese for “package” and one of them implies a small package. **Always ask for advice.**
