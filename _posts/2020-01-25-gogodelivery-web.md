After launching GOGO Delivery on mobile, we found that a small percentage of our users created a large percentage of orders. Through data and user interviews, we learned that these users were merchants selling food and beverages, beauty products, home electronics, pet products and such. They also had a need of placing multiple orders on a regular basis. When visiting their stores and offices, we found that most of the operations staff sat behind a computer while working with their e-commerce platforms. To support merchants, we launched **GOGO Delivery for business** so they can work more efficiently.

## Order management

The order management table is designed for maximum productivity. The most important information is shown to minimize interaction. For example, merchants can filter orders by status and see the information for multiple packages during courier pick-up without clicking into the order details individually.

## Bulk import

Merchants prefer to consolidate orders and place them at the same time each day. Enabling bulk import for deliveries would save them a lot of time as they already use spreadsheets to manage orders from their ecommerce platform. The biggest challenge of this feature was data validation. I created a spreadsheet template with examples and data validation for some fields like phone number and package size, but the address had to be validated through a maps platform. In our usability tests, merchants found an editable table created the most efficient experience.

## Print shipping labels

During our store visits, we found that many merchants wrote the address and pick-up verification code on labels or directly on the packages. To aid this process, we introduced shipping labels that merchants can choose to print after placing their orders. Interestingly, when we tested this with merchants, some said they still preferred to hand-write to save the environment and printing costs.
