I joined Happy Owl in May 2016 to design the first MVP. 

Happy Owl aimed to solve partner bars and restaurants' problem of a lack of customers during non-peak hours. We increased traffic by offering one drink per day to customers at a low monthly price at any of the venues. 

After talking to potential users, we found that the most likely paying customers are 25–35 young professionals working in finance. When it comes to going out for drinks with friends and colleagues, the first decision they make is the district. Another important factor when deciding on a venue is the atmosphere, and type of drinks and food provided.

In the first version of the flow, I prioritized the district selection, map view, and venue list with clear images and description. I also added Nearby venue, a secondary flow as users tend to decide on a venue before heading out (ie. before leaving work.)

The drink redemption process required:
- Clear instructions for the member to pass their phone to the venue staff.
- The redeem action cannot be easily triggered by accident.
- The redeem action is easy enough so the staff can be trained easily (training our 40+ venues was time intensive for our operations team.)

With the help of event promotions, word of mouth and media coverage, we reached over 1,000 downloads and 300 paying subscribers by the end of the first month.

Happy Owl featured on the App Store and named one of four handy apps for Hong Kong drinkers: [http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people](http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people)
