I joined Happy Owl in May 2016 to design a minimum viable product.  Happy Owl aimed to solve partner bars and restaurants' problem of **a lack of customers during non-peak hours**. We increased traffic by **offering one drink per day to customers at a low monthly price** at any of the venues. 

## Discovery

After talking to potential users, we found that the most likely paying customers are 25â€“35 young professionals working in finance. When it comes to going out for drinks with friends and colleagues, the first decision they make is **the district** (most prefer Central for its proximity to offices). Other factors include the venue's atmosphere, and type of drinks and food provided.

In the first version of the flow, we prioritized the district selection, map view, and venue list with clear images and description. We also added nearby venues, a secondary flow for users who want to discover bars on the go.

## Drink redemption experience

The drink redemption process required:
- **Clear instructions** for the member to pass their phone to the venue staff.
- The redeem action **cannot be easily triggered** by accident.
- The redeem action is **easy enough so the staff can be trained** quickly (training our 40+ venues was time intensive for our operations team.)

## Identity design

Our visual identity is fun, friendly, and energetic. The user colors in the user interface is kept to a minimal to make the photography pop. The photos capture the vibrant experiences of different venues and having fun with friends. We used a dark theme for the UI design, as the app is primarily used in dark environments at night. The accent yellow color creates contrast with the dark interface and resembles beer. Our typographic approach makes use of geometry and roundness to reflect the brand's personality.

After sketching dozens and dozens of owls, we decided to work with a playful owl face that fills the square picture plane to create a visually compelling and functional design. We applied our brand's bright blue and pink colors (inspired by Hong Kong nightlife and neon signs) to the owl, which also mimics Asian flush to add a bit of humor to the character.

## Results

We released the app in July 2016 and threw a launch party at Zuma (featuring an owl ice luge.) With the help of event promotions, word of mouth and media coverage, we reached over 1,000 downloads and 300 paying subscribers by the end of the first month.

Happy Owl was featured on the App Store and named <a href="http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people" target="_blank">one of four handy apps for Hong Kong drinkers.</a>
