I joined <a href="https://hypebeast.com" target="_blank">HYPEBEAST</a> in January 2017. HYPEBEAST is a digital media and e-commerce platform with a focus in fashion and footwear. I get to work on HYPEBEAST, HBX, HYPEBAE, and POPBEE products across iOS, Android and the web. Here are some of the projects I've worked on so far:

## Feed personalization

We added a personalized feed to the HYPEBEAST app to make it easier for our readers to view relevant content.

## Drops

We created a calendar for hypebeasts to track upcoming releases and find out where to buy.

## HBX app gesture browsing

We designed a visual language influenced by brutalism and updated the product-browsing navigation to create a new shopping experience.

## HBX find your size

We improved the usability of the size recommendation by simplifying the measurements input and making subtle styling changes. It resulted in increased click rate and reduced the item return rate.
