I joined [HYPEBEAST](https://hypebeast.com) in January 2017. HYPEBEAST is a digital media and e-commerce platform with a focus in fashion and footwear. I get to work on HYPEBEAST, HBX, HYPEBAE, and POPBEE products across iOS, Android and the web. Here are some of the projects I've worked on so far:

## Feed personalization

## Drops

## HBX Kids

## HBX app revamp
