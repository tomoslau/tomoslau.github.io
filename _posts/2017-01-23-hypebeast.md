I joined <a href="https://hypebeast.com" target="_blank">HYPEBEAST</a> in January 2017. HYPEBEAST is a digital media and e-commerce platform with a focus in fashion and footwear. I get to work on HYPEBEAST, HBX, HYPEBAE, and POPBEE products across iOS, Android and the web. Here are some of the projects I've worked on so far:

## Feed personalization

We added a personalized feed to the HYPEBEAST app to make it easier for our readers to view relevant content.

## Drops

We created a calendar for hypebeasts to track upcoming releases and find out where to buy.

## HBX app revamp
