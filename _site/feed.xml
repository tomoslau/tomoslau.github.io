HYPEBEAST is a digital media and e-commerce platform with a focus in fashion and footwear. I get to work on HYPEBEAST, HBX, HYPEBAE, and POPBEE products across iOS, Android and the web. Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feed-personalization&quot;&gt;Feed personalization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added a personalized feed to the HYPEBEAST app to make it easier for our readers to view relevant content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hb-app.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Your Feed on Android app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drops&quot;&gt;Drops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a calendar for hypebeasts to track upcoming releases and find out where to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hb-drops.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HYPEBEAST Drops&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hbx-app&quot;&gt;HBX app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduced a gesture-based product browsing navigation and designed a new visual language to improve the shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;

I designed the visual interface and worked closely with the UX team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bupa is a healthcare group headquartered in the United Kingdom. It expanded into Hong Kong in 1976 and has been a health insurance and healthcare provision business since. Their audience are professional individuals and companies looking for a healthcare plan for their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the new bupa.com.hk based on their global style guide. We applied it whenever possible and extended the style guide for region-specific content and elements from designs that we proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reviewed feedback on the current site and discovered that people found it difficult to find a suitable insurance plan through the website. We did an analysis and found that product names were vague and non-descriptive, the wide range of plans and broad categories  were hard to browse, and the website wasn’t mobile-optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brainstormed on how to simplify the flow, and proceeded with the idea of adding a simple recommendation and quotation engine. We added a simple form on the home page where customers fill in four fields and immediately get three recommended plans. They can choose to refine the pricing by adding more information and enroll the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flow wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning (at the top of the funnel) looks the simplest, and with each step the flow becomes more specific and there is more information and data input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Input a few pieces of information to receive three recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare and select a plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine the quotation by choosing payment and plan options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long form for personal details and a series of yes/no health questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-desktop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Medical insurance plans and quotation engine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the recommended plans view to be in the same style as regular cards, but expanded vertically to show more information. The information is divided into sections and displayed in an underlying grid so the same information can be easily scanned across all three plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early feedback and testing of the wireframes showed that many people found the forms long and overwhelming. In addition to breaking up the long forms into smaller chunks and steps, we tested the idea of using placeholders as labels. Bupa and our team were initially drawn to this idea because it made the forms appear less overwhelming—the forms looked “cleaner” and the reduced vertical space meant less scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the density of Traditional Chinese characters, labels are easier to read in a larger size and lighter weight than smaller size and heavier weight. Material Design recommends increasing “Dense scripts” by 1 point from the specified size for English. This adds more vertical space for Chinese form labels, plus exaggerates the visual density when compared to using placeholders as labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using placeholders as labels create a number of usability problems, as summarized by Katie Sherwin of Nielsen Norman Group. Here are the top three reasons that applied to the forms we were designing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strains short-term memory: users have to delete what they wrote to reveal the placeholder label again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users cannot check their input with the label (especially important for browsers with autocomplete)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Empty vs non-empty fields are less noticeable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-labels.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional labels, placeholder labels and float labels.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compromised by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmds.is%2Ffloat-label-pattern%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;float labels&lt;/a&gt;. Float labels allow the empty form to appear more clean and less overwhelming, while solving the usability problems of placeholder labels to a certain extent. When asked which form looks less overwhelming, most people picked the one with float labels over labels on top of fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-form.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enrollment form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website launched in early 2017. Bupa loved the brand new clean, simple and functional design. The new website increased sales leads by 200% and online purchases by 300%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Owl aimed to solve partner bars and restaurants’ problem of a lack of customers during non-peak hours. We increased traffic by offering one drink per day to customers at a low monthly price at any of the venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking to potential users, we found that the most likely paying customers are 25–35 young professionals working in finance. When it comes to going out for drinks with friends and colleagues, the first decision they make is the district (most prefer Central for its proximity to offices.) Other factors include the venue’s  atmosphere, and type of drinks and food provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first version of the flow, we prioritized the district selection, map view, and venue list with clear images and description. We also added nearby venues, a secondary flow for users who want to discover bars on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-discovery-wireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl discovery wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drink-redemption-experience&quot;&gt;Drink redemption experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drink redemption process required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear instructions for the member to pass their phone to the venue staff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The redeem action cannot be easily triggered by accident.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The redeem action is easy enough so the staff can be trained easily (training our 40+ venues was time intensive for our operations team.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;identity-design&quot;&gt;Identity design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visual identity is fun, friendly, and energetic. The user colors in the user interface is kept to a minimal to make the photography pop. The photos capture the vibrant experiences of different venues and having fun with friends. We used a dark theme for the UI design, as the app is primarily used in dark environments at night. The accent yellow color creates contrast with the dark interface and resembles beer. Our typographic approach makes use of geometry and roundness to reflect the brand’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-colors.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl color palette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-type.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl typography&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sketching dozens and dozens of owls, we decided to work with a playful owl face that fills the square picture plane to create a visually compelling and functional design. We applied our brand’s bright blue and pink colors (inspired by Hong Kong nightlife and neon signs) to the owl, which also mimics Asian flush to add a bit of humor to the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl app mockups&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released the app in July 2016 and threw a launch party at Zuma (featuring an owl ice luge.) With the help of event promotions, word of mouth and media coverage, we reached over 1,000 downloads and 300 paying subscribers by the end of the first month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Owl was featured on the App Store and named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of four handy apps for Hong Kong drinkers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
