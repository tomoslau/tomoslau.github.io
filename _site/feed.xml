&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypebeast.com&quot;&gt;HYPEBEAST&lt;/a&gt; in January 2017. HYPEBEAST is a digital media and e-commerce platform with a focus in fashion and footwear. I get to work on HYPEBEAST, HBX, HYPEBAE, and POPBEE products across iOS, Android and the web. Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on so far:&lt;/p&gt;

I designed the visual interface and worked closely with the UX team to improve the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[insert description of Bupa here]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[brief - applying the global style / loosely based on it~ however content and objectives of the website is different from other regions]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discover / research&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reviewed feedback on the current site and discovered that people found it difficult to find a suitable insurance plan through the website. We did an analysis and found that product names were vague or nondescriptive, the wide range of plans and broad categories displayed in list form were hard to browse, and the website wasn’t mobile-optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brainstormed on how to simplify the flow, and proceeded with the idea of adding a simple recommendation engine and introducing online quotation and enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added a simple form on the home page where users can fill in four fields and get three recommended plans. They can choose to refine the pricing by adding more information and enroll the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copy and visuals play a key role in making the forms look simple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help users find the right plan for themselves and family members&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduce online quotation and enrollment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make forms less tedious to fill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual design to align with global brand guidelines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Recommendation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the product recommendation flow to make it easier for users to find suitable plans. It’s the secondary call to action on the landing page behind “Contact us/Let us contact you,” and the primary action on the medical insurance landing page — where users can alternatively browse all the products in cards views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user fills in four pieces of information, written in first person copy to make it personal, and receives three recommended products with estimated quotations. The products are displayed in columns to make it easy to compare the product details below. If the user is interested, they can refine the quote and enroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online enrollment — making forms more usable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early feedback and testing of the wireframes showed that many people found the forms long and overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to breaking up the long forms into smaller chunks and steps, using placeholders as labels was suggested in a meeting. This made the forms appear less overwhelming, especially on desktop where more fields are visible in a single viewport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the density of Traditional Chinese characters, labels are easier to read in a larger size and lighter weight than smaller size and heavier weight. Material Design recommends increasing “Dense scripts” by 1 point from the specified size for English. This adds more vertical space for Chinese form labels, plus exaggerates the visual density when compared to using placeholders as labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I strongly advised against using placeholders as labels. There are a number of usability problems, as summarized by Katie Sherwin of Nielsen Norman Group. Here are my top three reasons that applied to the forms we were designing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strains short-term memory: users have to delete what they wrote to reveal the placeholder label again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users cannot check their input with the label (especially important for browsers with autocomplete)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empty vs non-empty fields are less noticeable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We originally used six different colors from the Bupa brand guideline. At some point, we used large blocks of different colors to make the pages more interesting. However, the extra colors didn’t give any meaning, and added visual clutter. I ended up stripping away all the colors, leaving only the Bupa blue as primary color and fuchsia as an accent color. The fuchsia compliments the blue nicely and is vibrant while providing enough contrast on white to meet WCAG guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project took around X months to design with three rounds of visual deign revisions. Bupa loved the brand new clean, simple and functional design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked closely with our UX consultant, project manager, and creative director in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Happy Owl in May 2016 to design the first MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Owl aimed to solve partner bars and restaurants’ problem of a lack of customers during non-peak hours. We increased traffic by offering one drink per day to customers at a low monthly price at any of the venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking to potential users, we found that the most likely paying customers are 25–35 young professionals working in finance. When it comes to going out for drinks with friends and colleagues, the first decision they make is the district. Another important factor when deciding on a venue is the atmosphere, and type of drinks and food provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first version of the flow, I prioritized the district selection, map view, and venue list with clear images and description. I also added Nearby venue, a secondary flow as users tend to decide on a venue before heading out (ie. before leaving work.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/ho-wireframes-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drink redemption process required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear instructions for the member to pass their phone to the venue staff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The redeem action cannot be easily triggered by accident.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The redeem action is easy enough so the staff can be trained easily (training our 40+ venues was time intensive for our operations team.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of event promotions, word of mouth and media coverage, we reached over 1,000 downloads and 300 paying subscribers by the end of the first month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Owl featured on the App Store and named one of four handy apps for Hong Kong drinkers: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people&quot;&gt;http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
