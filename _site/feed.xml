&lt;p&gt;As a moderate sneakerhead, I often went on HYPEBEAST to read about the latest and upcoming sneaker releases. I rarely browsed the home feed because the “Latest” feed was full of content from other categories that I wasn’t as interested about. I found myself always tapping on “Footwear” on the navigation bar. On mobile, this was two additional taps. So I told my interviewer that I would love HYPEBEAST to show more relevant content to readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became one of the first projects I got to work on after joining HYPEBEAST in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;validating-the-problem&quot;&gt;Validating the problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by talking about the problem internally and found out a majority of us had the same problem. We also learned that although our readers have similar interests in streetwear (mainly fashion and footwear), they also have different interests in other news categories like art, design, and automotive. We wanted to make it easier for readers to view content that they want to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-solutions&quot;&gt;Testing solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward solution we had was to create a filter that is saved to the reader’s profile. News aggregators, like Feedly, Flipboard, and Apple News are great at doing this. Readers are shown stories based on topics and news sources they follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NWE17Q7StqRmkhM42v8KCw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to use an algorithm to show users stories based on their engagement, like how Google News suggests stories based on users’ search activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to go ahead with allowing users to pick their interests so that users have more control over what they see, as well as fitting within the project timeline constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations--project-constraints&quot;&gt;Limitations / Project constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The feature is to be rolled out on iOS and Android apps first, since there are more loyal readers there compared to the web, where traffic is predominantly coming from social media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The latest feed remains as the default landing feed to always show pinned feature and sale posts at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personalization supports all five languages — now six (with different categories per language.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-friction&quot;&gt;Reducing friction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app personalization is linked to the user’s account instead of storing locally so that it’s synced across devices (and on web in the future), just like the existing bookmarks feature. Ideally this feature could be synced, but also available to non-registered users. However, due to technical constraints and marketing incentives, we decided to make it available for registered users only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cater our multilingual readers, we linked categories across different languages so they don’t have to set up their preferences again when they switch to a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WbFoot4UTue8jbgq2JY3sQ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early prototype I created in Origami.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask new readers to pick their interests right after sign up. Returning readers and those who skip sign up see an empty state with a call to action when they tap on “Your Feed” tab. This way, users know about the feature, but also have the option to browse without signing up or personalizing their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*W-WNAWaa9A-zvJP9hRfcZA.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although images add a visual impact to the design, it’s unrealistic because they have to be updated frequently, as “hype” products go out of trend very quickly. Displaying the list of categories inline allowed the flexibility for different languages to fill up the modal from the bottom without creating excessive vertical space and hindering reachability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extendability&quot;&gt;Extendability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feed is the first step of user personalization. We also looked at rolling out personalized notifications with the same categories selected for the feed, along with a tailored newsletter experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the onboarding flow with personalized notifications in mind. By adding a notification prompt right after the reader chooses their topics, it becomes more relevant and meaningful. Previously, the prompt was triggered based on a number of page views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after creating a prototype and testing it with users, I realized I was wrong to assume that people wanted to receive notifications based on the same topics they chose for their feed. Some users wanted to receive more specific notifications, and some wanted a wider set of notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the feedback, we created options that allow users to select different topics for notifications. We suggested categorizing notifications by &lt;em&gt;Breaking News&lt;/em&gt;, which is pushed less frequently but includes all categories, and &lt;em&gt;Your Topics&lt;/em&gt;. The unlinked option allows more customization, but adds additional steps to the onboarding flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-learned&quot;&gt;What we learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of October 2017 (four months since launch), there are 31,002 subscribers out of 150,527 monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;96% of users are subscribed to Fashion, and 95% Footwear. 63% Music.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A majority of users subscribe to two categories, with the number falling off as the number of categories increase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subscribers view Your Feed once every three days on average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*isVJbFBPdDvVQ58no0cXpA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the amount of Fashion and Footwear content published compared to other categories, users subscribed to both Fashion and Footwear end up having similar feeds between Latest (landing feed) and Your Feed. To make the feed more relevant and personal to each user, we redefined Your Feed as “popular stories about things you care about that you haven’t seen yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We recently modified the feed by only showing posts above a certain level of “hype” — a metric we rolled out on website from views and engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test and build a “seen” feature, so that stories that have been read or seen by the user won’t be shown again on the feed. This will allow us to test a wider range of sorting, since the latest posts won’t always have to be at the top for the feed to appear fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test algorithms where posts are shown based on the user’s browsing history, hype, time published. For example, a user who reads a lot about Off-White will see more stories about Off-White in their feed. This also reduces friction by allowing us to remove the Choose Your Topics flow, and Your Feed will be accessible to everyone immediately, hopefully reducing drop-off and allowing our non registered users to view Your Feed.&lt;/li&gt;

I focus on design, front-end web development, user testing, and data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovering-the-problem&quot;&gt;Discovering the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our project spawned from a specific problem my colleagues and I faced during the summer of 2015. Lucas, Matthieu and I worked in a small office room. We loved to play music on speakers while we worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-office.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set up was simple. Matthieu hooked up his computer to the speakers, and played music on Spotify. Although we shared similar tastes in music, Lucas and I would make song requests whenever we felt like a change of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did we feel the urge to change the music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To share music that we like&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To have a sense of control, a voice/opinion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change the mood by playing something different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, we sensed that requesting songs became disruptive to our work. We tried sending Spotify links on Slack to make it easier for Matthieu, but it still felt disruptive. We tried using a shared playlist on Spotify, but it didn’t feel spontaneous. What if we could each queue songs from our own computer without bothering each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-sketch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Four years at art school and I still can’t draw straight lines.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to build an app to do that. A jukebox for our office room that uses Spotify’s API. At the beginning, we didn’t even consider validating our problem and idea with anybody else. We simply wanted to build something we could use in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we designed and developed the prototype, we realized that we could use the jukebox app outside of the office — for things like house parties and startup events that we organized or attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Initial host and guest diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host is responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hosting the jukebox through the app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inviting guests by sharing the jukebox link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learns about the jukebox at the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opens the link to jukebox on browser (no log-in required to reduce friction), and sees the song currently playing and queued songs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adds songs to the queue and upvote songs added by others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-web.png&quot; alt=&quot;Web app screenshots&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a small party, the host can easily tell everyone about the jukebox, and share a link to them through a group chat. At larger events, this becomes more tricky. Strangers are less likely to try something new, so broadcasting it is not as easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-swhk.png&quot; alt=&quot;We tested Jook at a Startup Weekend event by word of mouth and handouts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;↑ One of our first tests at a Startup Weekend event by word of mouth and handouts (like the one on this table above the Subway napkin).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested Jook whenever possible—at the office, events, and parties. Getting organizers to host a jukebox turned out to be easier than we thought. After observing and talking to guests and hosts, this is what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users felt the need to keep adding songs when their jukebox ran out of songs in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They spent a lot of time stuck at the search bar thinking of what song to add.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They often opened Spotify to find a song from their library, and then went back to Jook to search the song.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At large events, hosts noticed that guests prefer to walk up to and use the host’s device (ie. an iPad) rather than manually typing in the url when a share link is not sent to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;People who care about music vs number of people at event&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we also recognized is that not everyone has a strong music preference, especially at larger events. Some people have a strong urge to comment on or suggest a song when they walk into a party or event, while others are happy with whatever is playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;features-we-added-prior-to-public-beta&quot;&gt;Features we added prior to public beta&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fallback playlist: where the host can select a playlist to fallback on when there are no songs left in the queue, so that the jukebox will never run out of songs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drag-and-drop songs from Spotify directly to Jook on web browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preview song snippets before adding them to the jukebox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jook-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;We added a fallback playlist feature so the jukebox will never run out of songs to play.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also added a prominent “Send Feedback” button to encourage our users to send us valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since releasing Jook, hosts have created more than 500 jukeboxes with over 5,000 guests. We learned several things from our users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-they-loved&quot;&gt;What they loved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An easy way to play everyone’s favorite music in an environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voting songs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ease of adding songs on desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-they-struggled-with&quot;&gt;What they struggled with&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding songs to add on mobile (no drag-and-drop in app or mobile web)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not knowing that a Spotify Premium account is needed to host a jukebox (high drop-off rate on login screen in app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-they-asked-for&quot;&gt;What they asked for&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Downvote to drop unpopular songs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow hosts to remove songs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explicit songs filter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Android app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all the users who helped us test the product and gave us amazing feedback. Especially the ones who shared with us the images of posters they made for their parties ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re continuously looking at the data and feedback from our lovely users, and working towards a big update.&lt;/p&gt;

I designed the visual interface and worked closely with the UX team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bupa is a healthcare group headquartered in the United Kingdom. It expanded into Hong Kong in 1976 and has been a health insurance and healthcare provision business since. Their audience are professional individuals and companies looking for a healthcare plan for their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the new bupa.com.hk based on their global style guide. We applied it whenever possible and extended the style guide for region-specific content and elements from designs that we proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reviewed feedback on the current site and discovered that people found it difficult to find a suitable insurance plan through the website. We did an analysis and found that product names were vague and non-descriptive, the wide range of plans and broad categories  were hard to browse, and the website wasn’t mobile-optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brainstormed on how to simplify the flow, and proceeded with the idea of adding a simple recommendation and quotation engine. We added a simple form on the home page where customers fill in four fields and immediately get three recommended plans. They can choose to refine the pricing by adding more information and enroll the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flow wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning (at the top of the funnel) looks the simplest, and with each step the flow becomes more specific and there is more information and data input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Input a few pieces of information to receive three recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare and select a plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine the quotation by choosing payment and plan options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long form for personal details and a series of yes/no health questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-desktop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Medical insurance plans and quotation engine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the recommended plans view to be in the same style as regular cards, but expanded vertically to show more information. The information is divided into sections and displayed in an underlying grid so the same information can be easily scanned across all three plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early feedback and testing of the wireframes showed that many people found the forms long and overwhelming. In addition to breaking up the long forms into smaller chunks and steps, we tested the idea of using placeholders as labels. Bupa and our team were initially drawn to this idea because it made the forms appear less overwhelming—the forms looked “cleaner” and the reduced vertical space meant less scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the density of Traditional Chinese characters, labels are easier to read in a larger size and lighter weight than smaller size and heavier weight. Material Design recommends increasing “Dense scripts” by 1 point from the specified size for English. This adds more vertical space for Chinese form labels, plus exaggerates the visual density when compared to using placeholders as labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using placeholders as labels create a number of usability problems, as summarized by Katie Sherwin of Nielsen Norman Group. Here are the top three reasons that applied to the forms we were designing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strains short-term memory: users have to delete what they wrote to reveal the placeholder label again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users cannot check their input with the label (especially important for browsers with autocomplete)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Empty vs non-empty fields are less noticeable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-labels.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional labels, placeholder labels and float labels.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compromised by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmds.is%2Ffloat-label-pattern%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;float labels&lt;/a&gt;. Float labels allow the empty form to appear more clean and less overwhelming, while solving the usability problems of placeholder labels to a certain extent. When asked which form looks less overwhelming, most people picked the one with float labels over labels on top of fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bupa-form.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enrollment form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website launched in early 2017. Bupa loved the brand new clean, simple and functional design. The new website increased sales leads by 200% and online purchases by 300%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Owl aimed to solve partner bars and restaurants’ problem of a lack of customers during non-peak hours. We increased traffic by offering one drink per day to customers at a low monthly price at any of the venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking to potential users, we found that the most likely paying customers are 25–35 young professionals working in finance. When it comes to going out for drinks with friends and colleagues, the first decision they make is the district (most prefer Central for its proximity to offices.) Other factors include the venue’s  atmosphere, and type of drinks and food provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first version of the flow, we prioritized the district selection, map view, and venue list with clear images and description. We also added nearby venues, a secondary flow for users who want to discover bars on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-discovery-wireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl discovery wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drink-redemption-experience&quot;&gt;Drink redemption experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drink redemption process required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear instructions for the member to pass their phone to the venue staff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The redeem action cannot be easily triggered by accident.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The redeem action is easy enough so the staff can be trained easily (training our 40+ venues was time intensive for our operations team.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;identity-design&quot;&gt;Identity design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visual identity is fun, friendly, and energetic. The user colors in the user interface is kept to a minimal to make the photography pop. The photos capture the vibrant experiences of different venues and having fun with friends. We used a dark theme for the UI design, as the app is primarily used in dark environments at night. The accent yellow color creates contrast with the dark interface and resembles beer. Our typographic approach makes use of geometry and roundness to reflect the brand’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-colors.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl color palette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ho-type.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Owl typography&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sketching dozens and dozens of owls, we decided to work with a playful owl face that fills the square picture plane to create a visually compelling and functional design. We applied our brand’s bright blue and pink colors (inspired by Hong Kong nightlife and neon signs) to the owl, which also mimics Asian flush to add a bit of humor to the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released the app in July 2016 and threw a launch party at Zuma (featuring an owl ice luge.) With the help of event promotions, word of mouth and media coverage, we reached over 1,000 downloads and 300 paying subscribers by the end of the first month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Owl was featured on the App Store and named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2055131/four-handy-apps-hong-kongs-drinkers-and-party-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of four handy apps for Hong Kong drinkers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
