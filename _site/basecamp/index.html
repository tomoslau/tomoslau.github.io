    <h1>
    	Hi â›°, I'm Tom Lau ðŸ‘‹
    </h1>
    <p>Is Tom my real name? Yes. My parents decided to give me an English name "Thomas" to make me seem posh (unfortunately I didn't live up to this). I get asked a lot because it's typical for Hong Kongers to give themselves English names if they're born without one. If I named myself, I would've chosen a more unique name so I can get dibs on account handles without racing against 300+ Tom Laus in the world. I did manage to get my Hey email address though ðŸ˜‰</p>
    <h2>
      Who am I?
    </h2> 
    <p>
      I grew up wanting to become a filmmaker, went to an art school, and ended up transforming into a UX/UI designer. Over the years working in agencies and in-house companies, I've grown to love taking ownership of projects and drive the business and product direction. I'm lucky to be able to work holistically in most of my career so far: research, prototyping, testing, visual, motion design, and writing HTML and CSS. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Currently, I'm building crowd-sourced last-mile delivery at <a href="http://gogox.com/">GogoX</a>. I'm the sole designer responsible for both the supply and demand side. I conduct continous research, develop product strategies, facilitate design workshops with business stakeholders and the functional team, validate ideas through tests and experiments, visual and motion design, and tweak the front-end code during implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not looking at a screen, I'm trying to hit a PR at the gym (nothing motivates me more than the progress I lost during the lockdowns), hiking with my dog, or practicing Muay Thai. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      What do I value?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Simplicity, ethical design, and aesthetics. In most cases, I believe simplification has a greater outcome than adding new features that creates more interaction cost. <a href="/gogo-delivery-mobile/">See a case study.</a> Ethics always comes first and I always challenge ideas that may put anyone in harm's way. For me, UX and UI are deeply interlinked â€” beauty in design creates more impact than most people realize.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why should you hire me?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Basecamp values strong opinions and I think you will benefit from mine. I'm a direct person (especially in Asian cultures where most feedback is given indirectly) and growing up in an international community in Hong Kong, living in the US and UK have given me a wide spectrum of perspectives of creatives from different cultures. 
    </p>
    <p>
      T-shaped or M-shaped? I'm a é¾–(double-dragon)-shaped designer â€” a super-generalist who loves challenges, especially in new areas that I'm not strong in because it gives me more opportunities to grow.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Hold up, how's the 4-hour CST overlap going to work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I currently live in Hong Kong, but I'm planning to move to London for my next role (I'm a British citizen). A lot of my friends and family have also moved to Europe in the last few years. I believe this is a good time for me to move due to the current political climate.
