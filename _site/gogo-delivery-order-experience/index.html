    <p>GOGOVAN launched a new crowd-sourced same-day delivery service in 2018 summer. Originally, the service targetted small-medium businesses with ad-hoc urgent delivery needs in Hong Kong. I was part of an ambitious project to find the product-market fit for GOGO delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>

<p>To find the product-market fit for GOGO delivery, our goals were to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improve order completion rate (activation/retention)</li>
  <li>Improve activation/retention for on-demand pro segment (e-commerce merchants)</li>
  <li>Improve courier activation</li>
</ol>

<figure><div class="ratio-4x3"><img class="lazy" data-src="/assets/ggd-roadmap.svg" alt="GOGO delivery product roadmap" /></div><figcaption>GOGO delivery product roadmap</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="my-role">My role</h2>

<p>I led the design for the delivery experience since the product launch in 2018 summer and collaborated with one designer on the on-demand pro features and two other designers to support delivery on the new client app.</p>

<p>In addition, I worked alongside a product manager and data analyst. We conducted continuous research through user interviews and usability testing.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-order-cancellations">Reducing order cancellations</h2>

<p>During the first week of launch, we noticed a high cancellation rate, where 80% of cancellations were due to shippers placing orders with oversized, overweight or multiple packages.</p>

<h3 id="process--experience">Process &amp; experience</h3>

<p>To understand the problem, I asked the experts from our operations and customer service team.</p>

<p>We found that new shippers assumed our couriers deliver packages using vans, but in reality, our couriers are walkers (they travel on foot and public transport). This led to oversized, overweight or multiple packages that were physically impossible for a courier to carry.</p>

<p>I tested the existing app with people unfamiliar with our service to dig deeper to the reasons why: most of them assumed packages were delivered by vans due to our brand “GOGOVAN” and that the order flow didn’t give them any idea of our courier’s mode of transport.</p>

<p>To tackle this problem, we ran a design sprint to come up with ideas and decide on what to test in our order flow prototype.</p>

		<img class="lazy" data-src="/assets/ggv-oversize-screens.png" alt="Prototype to test service clarity" />
	</div>
	<figcaption>Prototype to test service clarity</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The prototype included:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A redesigned service icon and name to clarify our couriers’ mode of transport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Package type options to show what kind of packages are acceptable for couriers to deliver</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helper text with a link to direct oversized delivery needs to our van service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An option for oversized packages that direct to our van service</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-outcome">The outcome</h3>

<p>Due to scope vs outcome, we decided to implement the new service icon, helper text, oversize/overweight options and not add package type options to the order form.</p>

<p>One month after the release, cancellations due to oversized items by new shippers reduced by 37%. Overall cancellation rate dropped 17%.</p>

<h2 id="scheduled-delivery-and-cut-off-times">Scheduled delivery and cut-off times</h2>

<p>Through interviews with e-commerce and brick and mortar store visits, we learned that shippers like to consolidate orders and place them all at once at the same time. Some shippers preferred placing multiple orders in the evening for the next day without worrying about it the next morning due to cutoff times. Many shippers also found it difficult to understand the cut-off time for each drop-off option.</p>

<h3 id="process--experience-1">Process &amp; experience</h3>

<p>To improve the clarity of drop-off times, we worked closely with operations and marketing team to adjust the drop-off and cut-off times that is more meaningful for both shippers and couriers.</p>

<p>We made the times easier to understand and more memorable by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplifying the same-day drop-off options to office-hours and after office-hours for residential deliveries</li>
  <li>Displaying all drop-off options even when they’re not available (in a disabled state)</li>
  <li>Adding helper text to make the cut-off times more transparent</li>
  <li>Rounding times to the closest hour</li>
</ul>

	<figcaption>Prototype to test the clarity of drop-off options and cut-off times</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We tested the prototype with users and they found the helper text most useful in understanding the options. However, some users found the “available if…” helper text on available options confusing, so we decided to only show it when the option is disabled.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="the-outcome-1">The outcome</h3>
<p>After shipping the scheduling feature, the percentage of scheduled orders increased by 270%. Scheduled orders make 20–30% of our daily orders.</p>

<h2 id="finding-relevant-orders-for-couriers">Finding relevant orders for couriers</h2>

<p>As our demand grew,  couriers found it difficult to find relevant orders. Supply couldn’t keep up with the demand, and completion rate dropped as a result. To increase completion rate, we decided to tackle the problem of difficulty in picking orders for couriers.</p>

<h3 id="process--experience-2">Process &amp; experience</h3>

<p>Through focus groups, we learned that couriers pick orders based on distance from pick up location, drop off location and earnings.</p>

<p>I led a design sprint with cross-functional teams to identify the key problems to tackle and decide which ideas to test.</p>

<p>We expolored the most popular idea: a visual map to show couriers available orders based on their location and suggesting bundling to increase efficiency and income.</p>

<p>We also explored using filters and sorting to help couriers find their optimal orders. We tested the prototype with couriers and made several iterations to suit their needs.  After discussing with engineers, we decided to go ahead with this solution based on effort and outcome.</p>

<p>Since shipping this feature, we received positive feedback from couriers and the completion rate increased.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h3 id="test-product-onboarding-with-new-users-unfamiliar-with-the-service">Test product onboarding with new users unfamiliar with the service</h3>

<p>The problem of shippers not understanding our service wasn’t identified during the closed beta period prior to launch because our sales team onboarded each user so they had a good understanding of the service. When new customers started using the service, the problems started to show up.</p>

<h3 id="listen-to-users-and-teammates-who-communicate-frequently-with-clients-on-a-regular-basis">Listen to users and teammates who communicate frequently with clients on a regular basis.</h3>

<p>Conducting frequent user interviews and sync-ups with our operations / customer service team gave us valuable insight into the problems we should prioritize and tackle.</p>

<h3 id="test-designs-and-get-feedback-early">Test designs and get feedback early</h3>

<p>Testing early gave us a more concrete direction and prevent tunnel vision. It also helped cross-functional teams understand the product roadmap and priorities. There were many times our hypotheses were proven wrong and saved us time.</p>
