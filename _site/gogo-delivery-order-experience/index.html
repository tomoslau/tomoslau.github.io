    <p>GOGOVAN launched a new crowd-sourced same-day delivery service in 2018 summer. The service targets small-medium businesses with ad-hoc urgent delivery needs in Hong Kong.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-oversize-and-overweight-orders">Reducing oversize and overweight orders</h2>

<p>During the first week of launch, we noticed a high cancellation rate, where 80% of cancellations were due to shippers placing orders with <strong>oversized, overweight or multiple packages</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="process--experience">Process &amp; experience</h3>

<p>To understand the problem, I asked the experts from our operations, customer service, engineering and data teams.</p>

<p>“Shippers assume our couriers deliver packages using <strong>vans</strong>,” Jackie, head of customer service, said, “but in reality, our couriers are <strong>walkers</strong> (couriers who travel on foot and public transport).” This led to oversized, overweight or multiple packages that were physically impossible for a courier to carry.</p>

<figure class="ratio-4x3"><img class="lazy" data-src="/assets/ggv-oversize-sketches.jpg" alt="Sketches and voting stickers to explore and decide which ideas to test in our prototype" /></figure>

<p>My PM Waikit and I made some quick sketches and voted to explore and decide which ideas to test in our prototype.</p>

<figure class="ratio-4x3"><img class="lazy" data-src="/assets/ggv-oversize-screens.png" alt="1. Added package type options to show what kind of packages are acceptable for couriers to deliver. 2. Helper text with a link to direct oversized delivery needs to our van service. 3. An option for oversized packages that direct to our van service." /></figure>

<ol>
  <li>Redesigned service icon and label to clarify our couriers’ <strong>mode of transport</strong></li>
  <li>Added package type options to show <strong>what kind of packages are acceptable for couriers to deliver</strong></li>
  <li>Helper text with a link to direct oversized delivery needs to our van service</li>
  <li>An option for oversized packages that direct to our van service</li>
</ol>

<p>We tested the prototype with five shippers unfamiliar with our new service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the new order screen, all testers understood that courier deliveries are carried out by a walker or biker.</li>
  <li>When tasked to place an order that exceeds the size or weight limit, all testers successfully switched to van service.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-outcome">The outcome</h3>

<p>Due to scope vs outcome, we decided to implement the new service icon, helper text, oversize/overweight options and not add package type options to the order form.</p>

<p>One month after the release, cancellations due to oversized items by new shippers reduced by 37%. Overall cancellation rate dropped 17%.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The problem of shippers not understanding our service wasn’t identified during the closed beta period prior to launch because our sales team onboarded each user so they had a good understanding of the service. When new customers started using the service, the problems started to show up. <strong>Test product onboarding with completely new users.</strong></li>
  <li>Talking to our operations and customer service team gave us valuable insight into the problems we were tackling because they communicated with the shippers frequently. <strong>Talk to people who listen to  our users’ problems regularly.</strong></li>
  <li>Asking for feedback on the product copy made me realize that simple words can be improved to convey more meaning. For example, I learned that there are different words in Chinese for “package” and one of them implies a small package. <strong>Always ask for advice.</strong></li>
</ol>
