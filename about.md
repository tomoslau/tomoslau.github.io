    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m a designer with skills across user experience, user interface, and front-end development. I enjoy working holistically in the design process: user research, product strategy, prototyping, usability testing, interaction, visual, and motion design.</p>
    <p>My current obsessions are trying to hit a post-covid PR at the gym and lying to my friends on Among Us.</p>

    <h2>What my colleagues say</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tom has consistently delivered quality work for Gogo Delivery on both [the client mobile app and business web app]. He always strived for the best outcome and was willing to put in extra effort to achieve the highest possible quality of work.</p>
      <p>Tom also set a very good example for our team's feedback and continuous improvement culture. He always looked for feedback on his work and responded to others' feedback with an objective discussion every single time. At the same time, he never hesitated to give direct and honest feedback to his peers to help others grow.</p>
