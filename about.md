    <p>Hi, I’m Tom.</p>
    <p>🦵 I like to squat.</p>
    <p>🎸 I also enjoy playing guitar, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRLfqkLBRKC/" target="_blank">drawing my dogs</a> (usually when they’re not looking) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BdO6rjIhtCs/" target="_blank">making custom sneakers</a>.</p>
    <p>✏️ As a kid I loved drawing and making videos, so I decided to go to an art school. After graduating, I somehow landed a job at a digital studio, where I taught myself HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>🤓 Since then, I’ve been working on campaigns, websites and products with brands and businesses. </p>
    <p>💭 I design products to be more useful, accessible, and pleasing. I enjoy working through the entire design process: from product thinking, research and testing to UI and interaction design.</p>
