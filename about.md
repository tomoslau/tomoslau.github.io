    <p>I’m a designer with skills across user experience, user interface, and front-end development. I enjoy working holistically in the design process: product thinking, research, prototyping, and user testing.</p>
    <p>When I'm not at work, you can find me trying to hit a PR at the gym, practicing Muay Thai, or playing FPS/MOBA games.</p>
