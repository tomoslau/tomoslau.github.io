# Notes from my favorite books

[Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me)

If there's one thing I learned from this book, it's “callous your mind.” David Goggins believes every human being is capable of doing much more (by having a stronger mind).

> **Physical challenges strengthen my mind so I'm ready for whatever life throws at me**

> Whether you are running on a treadmill or doing a set of push-ups, **get to a point where you are so tired and in pain that your mind is begging you to stop**. **Then push just 5 to 10 percent further**... It also resets your baseline, which is important because you're about to increase your workload another 5 to 10 percent the following week, and the week after that.

In racing:

Run at your own pace. Don't go too fast at the beginning.

> ... focused on his own pace, waited me out, and took my soul.

> In military, we would do a map study ahead of time and mark that turn on our maps, and another point about 200 meters past that turn, and a third an additional 150 meters past the second mark.

This makes sure soldiers know if they miss a turn. They also plan exit strategies based on these three routes in case anything happens.

Goggins thinks our culture is hooked to quick-fix and life hacks. Instead, he strives for a calloused mind or self-mastered mind by becoming addicted to **hard work**.

Similar to Arnold's speech, Goggins talks about streamlining time.

> It means scheduling your life like you're on a twenty-four-hour mission every single day... you must win the morning.

He also runs during lunch time and ride a bike to and from home.

> Listen to your body, sneak in those **ten- to twenty-minute power naps** when necessary, and **take one full rest day per week**. If it's a rest day, truly **allow your mind and body to relax**. Turn your phone off. Keep the computer shut down.

Goggins also held the record for most pull-ups in a day at some point, but he failed twice before (once on live tv) but he didn't give up. 

> **To exist in this world, we must contend with humiliation, broken dreams, sadness, and loss. That's just nature.** Each specific life comes with its own personalized portion of pain. 

> Thanks to all that **stretching**, I'm in better shape at forty-three than I was in my twenties.



[Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run)

Human beings survived by outrunning animals in long distances because we have the ability to sweat out the heat. Animals are limited to running short distances very quickly, but have to stop to rest. Somehow we beat the Neanderthals. It wasn't intelligence, strength, or weapons—could it be our running ability?

> We've got (an **Achilles tendon**), chimps don't. We have very different feet: ours are arched, chimps' are flat... And check out our butts: we've got a **hefty gluteus maximus**, chimps have virtually none.

> **All running mammals (except for humans) are restricted to the same cycle of take-a-step, take-a-breath.**

> Humans, with our millions of sweat glands, are the best air-cooled engine that evolution has ever put on the market.

> After about ten or fifteen kilometers' worth of running, (an antelope) will go into hyperthermia and collapse.

> **A few extra pounds of body weight make a huge difference**—so much so that to maintain heat balance, a 160-pound runner would lose nearly three minutes per mile in a marathon against a one hundred-pound runner (at temperatures over 90F/32C)

> One year after the September 11 attacks, trail-running suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country... maybe there's a trigger in the human psyche, a **coded response that activates our first and greatest survival skill when we sense the raptors approaching**.

> **In terms of stress relief and sensual pleasure, running is what you have in life before you have sex.**

> “I thought if you could run one hundred miles, you'd be in this Zen state. You'd be the fucking Buddha, bringing peace and a smile to the world. It didn't work in my case... the only thing in life that matters is finishing the run. For once, my brain isn't going blehblehbleh all the time. **Everything quiets down, and the only thing going on is pure flow.** It's just me and the movement and the motion. That's what I love—just being a barbarian, running through the woods.“ - Jenn

On shoes, Christopher McDougall believes all the running injuries like pronation and supination didn't exist before Nike invented running shoes in the 80s. With minimalist shoes (or barefoot), humans run mid-strike naturally. Nike running shoes made heel-striking a thing. The natural strides are mid-foot, with higher cadence. The foot acts as a cushion itself (and the Achilles tendon is unique to homo sapiens) 

> Slice the top off a ‘70s running shoe, and you had a sandal: the old Adidas and Onitsuka Tigers were just flat sole and laces, with no motion control, no arch support, no heel pad.

> “If you have a choice between one step or two between rocks, take three.” - Caballo

> A lot of foot and knee injuries that are currently plaguing us are actually caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet weak... Until 1972, when the modern athletic shoe was invented by Nike, people ran in very thin-soled shoes, had strong feet, and had much lower incidence of knee injuries. - Dr. Daniel Lieberman, professor of biological anthropology at Harvard

> **"If you strengthen the foot by going barefoot, I think you reduce the risk of Achilles and knee and plantar fascia problems**" - Lananna

> ... was a size twelve and flat-footed, and now I'm a nine or ten. As the muscles in my feet got stronger, my arch got higher.

> On a hard surface, your feet will briefly unlearn the habits they picked up in shoes and automatically shift to self-defense mode: you'll find yourself landing on the outside edge of your foot, then gently rolling from little toe over to big until your foot is flat. 

> **You don't stop running because you get old. You get old because you stop running.**

> Set it for one hundred eighty beats a minute, then run to the beat... **Kenyans have superquick foot turnover.** Quick, light leg contractions are more economical than big, forceful ones.

On training:

> The way to activate your fat-burning furnace is by staying below your aerobic threshold—your hard-breathing point–during your endurance runs.

> Only go as fast as you can while holding a conversation.



[Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint)

> Focusing on the surface allows you to move fast and answer big questions before you commit to execution, which is why any challenge, no matter how large, can benefit from a sprint.

> By asking people for their **input early in the process**, you help them **feel invested in the outcome**.

> It's important to write questions that don't reveal the “right” answers

> The trick is to take one or two steps upstream from the beginning of the actual solution you want to test.

> **85 percent of all problems were observed after just five people.**

> 1. A friendly welcome to start the interview 2. A series of general, open-ended context questions about the customer 3. Introduction to the prototype(s) 4. Detailed tasks to get the customer reacting to the prototype 5. A quick debrief to capture the customer's overarching thoughts and impressions

> “There are no right or wrong answers. Since I didn't design this, you won't hurt my feelings or flatter me. In fact, **frank, candid feedback is the most helpful**.”

> “As we go, please think aloud. Tell me what you're trying to do and how you think you can do it. If you get confused or don't understand something, please tell me. If you see things you like, tell me that, too.“

> Look for patterns that show up with three or more customers. If only two customers reacted in the same way but it was an especially strong reaction, make note of that, too.

> Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right.

> When managers explain what their plan is without giving the reasons for it, people wonder what the “real” agenda is.

> Negative feedback may be fun, but it is far less brave than endorsing something unproven and providing room for it to grow.

> If animators want a character to reach for something to their left, they anticipate that a split-second earlier by having the character move ever so subtly to the right.

> One technique I've used to soften the process is to ask everyone in the room to make two lists: the top five things that they would do again and the top five things that they wouldn't do again. People find it easier to be candid if they balance the negative with the positive, and a good facilitator can make it easier for the balance to be struck.

> To have a “not know mind” is a goal of creative people. It means you are open to the new, just as children are.

> Driving the train doesn't set its course. The real job is laying the track.

> What is the point of hiring smart people, we asked, if you don't empower them to fix what's broken?

> Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. Give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.

> Always try to hire people who are smarter than you.

> Show early and show often.

[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens)

> If this is the case, then today's Eurasians are not pure Sapiens. They are a mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals. Similarly, when Sapiens reached East Asia, they interbred with the local Erectus, so the Chinese and Koreans are a mixture of Sapiens and Erectus.

> “The longer you wait to fire someone the longer it has been since you should have fired them”

> “I went running down the fucking street in Boulder, and the only place that was open sold these shitty trinkets, and they were about to close. The best thing I could find were these plastic monkeys with coconuts—those ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ monkeys.”

> “Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It's like a Psych 101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play Flappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy Bird, but at least there is some physics involved.”
