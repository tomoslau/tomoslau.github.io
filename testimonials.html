                        <p>Since Tom took up ownership of the Crypto.com App, I could see how he shaped the team to have
                            more processes, set up regular chats amongst the team and created a channel for the team to
                            share and provide critiques to each other. He also helped nurture the "challenge" mindset in
                            the team, so they know they have & are empowered to challenge stakeholders. The team
                            respects and looks up to Tom as a manager. Honestly, the Crypto.com App came a long way from
                            how it was before and this is hugely thanks to what he has been helping to shape.</p>

                        <p>Tom is a clear communicator and engineers clearly enjoy working with him. I was able to get my message across very easily and vice versa - I found him great to work with since he communicates succinctly and directly.
                            He involves the engineering team in the design process to get our input and understands our constraints to incorporate it in the product and design roadmap decisions.</p>
