I joined <a href="https://hypebeast.com" target="_blank">HYPEBEAST</a> in January 2017. HYPEBEAST is a digital media and e-commerce platform with a focus in fashion and footwear. I get to work on HYPEBEAST, HBX, HYPEBAE, and POPBEE products across iOS, Android and the web. Here are selected projects I've worked on so far:

## Feed personalization

We added a personalized feed to the HYPEBEAST app to make it easier for our readers to view relevant content. We tested algorithms to display content based on userâ€™s browsing history, popularity, and time published.

## Drops

We created a calendar for streetwear enthusiasts to track upcoming releases and find out where to buy.

## HBX size recommendation

We tested different solutions with a goal of reducing customer returns. We designed an easier and more accurate size recommendation, and reduced total returns by 86%.
